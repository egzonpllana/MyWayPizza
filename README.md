# My Way Pizza #

# Swifty Protocol-Oriented with Dependency Injection #
    Building an iOS app for ordering Pizza with mocked APIs from the Apiary 
    specification using Swift. 
    
## Preview ##


## Challenge ##
    Api:
    • The API is static so no matter what you send you will get the same answer.   
    • You can find the API’s here: https://pizzaapp.docs.apiary.io/
    
    To do:
    • Show a list of pizza restaurants and have the closest to your current location at the top.
    • From the list enter into a detail view for that restaurant and display the available 
    menu for that location.
    • Let the users add items from the menu into a shopping cart 
    • Place the order
    • Display the orders state

## Application Design Pattern ##

### Swifty Protocol-Oriented Dependency Injection ###

    • The key to dependency injection is protocols – from there sprouts many variations,
    flavours, and techniques.
    • Battle-tested DI implementation with no outside dependencies or magic. 
    • It combines protocol extension and type erasure to give you a solid, flexible dependency
    injection that works great with unit test and even frameworks.
    
### MVVM ###
